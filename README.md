# Spectral Analysis of Multiscale Sample Covariance Matrices
This project was done as my senior honors thesis in mathematics during my undergraduate studies. It investigates the spectral properties of multiscale sample covariance matrices across low- and high-dimensional regimes, with particular focus on dependence structures induced by fractional Brownian motion. By combining rigorous theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations, I was able to identify distinct universality classes in the eigenvalue fluctuations of multiscale sample covariance matrices, including asymptotically Gaussian and beta-Hermite-type regimes, arising from the interplay of dependence and dimensionality. The 'code' folder contains the R scripts used to generate the simulations and figures in the thesis.
