This project was done as my senior honors thesis in mathematics during my undergraduate studies. It investigates the spectral properties of multiscale sample covariance matrices across low- and high-dimensional regimes, with particular focus on dependence structures induced by fractional Brownian motion. By combining rigorous theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations, I was able to identify distinct universality classes in the eigenvalue fluctuations of multiscale sample covariance matrices, including asymptotically Gaussian and beta-Hermite-type regimes, arising from the interplay of dependence and dimensionality.
