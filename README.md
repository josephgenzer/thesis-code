This project analyzes the spectral properties of multiscale sample covariance matrices under varying long-range dependence and dimensionality. It highlights deviations from classical behavior, compares eigenvalue statistics to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) and beta-Hermite ensembles, and uncovers structure induced by multiscale temporal dynamics.
